   - Required version: >= 0.20.2 (not yet released)

### Resolved Vulnerabilities

#### Next.js Vulnerabilities (FIXED âœ…)
- **Cache Key Confusion for Image Optimization API Routes** - Fixed by updating to Next.js 15.5.4
- **Content Injection Vulnerability for Image Optimization** - Fixed by updating to Next.js 15.5.4
- **Improper Middleware Redirect Handling Leads to SSRF** - Fixed by updating to Next.js 15.5.4

### Mitigation Strategies

#### For xlsx vulnerabilities:
1. **Input Validation**: All Excel file uploads are validated and sanitized
2. **Server-side Processing**: Excel files are processed on the server, not client-side
3. **Limited File Access**: Uploaded files are stored securely in S3 with restricted access
4. **Regular Updates**: Monitor for xlsx package updates and apply patches when available

### Recommended Actions

1. **Monitor xlsx package**: Check for updates regularly
2. **Consider alternatives**: Evaluate alternative Excel processing libraries if needed
3. **Security headers**: Ensure proper security headers are in place
4. **Regular audits**: Run `pnpm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@your-domain.com
- Or create a private security advisory in the GitHub repository

## Security Best Practices

1. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data to version control
3. **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
6. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices and is regularly audited for vulnerabilities.
