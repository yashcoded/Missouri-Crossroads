## Security Audit Status

Last updated: December 2024

### ✅ All Vulnerabilities Resolved

**Current Status: No known vulnerabilities found**

All previously identified security vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved.

### Resolved Vulnerabilities

#### Next.js Vulnerabilities (FIXED ✅)
- **Cache Key Confusion for Image Optimization API Routes** - Fixed by updating to Next.js 15.5.4
- **Content Injection Vulnerability for Image Optimization** - Fixed by updating to Next.js 15.5.4
- **Improper Middleware Redirect Handling Leads to SSRF** - Fixed by updating to Next.js 15.5.4

#### xlsx Package Vulnerabilities (FIXED ✅)
- **Prototype Pollution in sheetJS** - Resolved by removing unused xlsx dependency
- **SheetJS Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** - Resolved by removing unused xlsx dependency

### Resolution Strategy

The xlsx package was identified as having high-severity vulnerabilities but was not actually being used in the codebase. The security issues were resolved by:
1. **Dependency Audit**: Identified that xlsx was listed as a dependency but not imported or used
2. **Safe Removal**: Removed the unused xlsx package completely
3. **Verification**: Confirmed that removing xlsx didn't break any functionality
4. **Security Confirmation**: Verified that all vulnerabilities are now resolved

### Recommended Actions

1. **Monitor xlsx package**: Check for updates regularly
2. **Consider alternatives**: Evaluate alternative Excel processing libraries if needed
3. **Security headers**: Ensure proper security headers are in place
4. **Regular audits**: Run `pnpm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@your-domain.com
- Or create a private security advisory in the GitHub repository

## Security Best Practices

1. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data to version control
3. **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
6. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices and is regularly audited for vulnerabilities.
